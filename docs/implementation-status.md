## Reconciliation evidence

| Capability | Status | Evidence and remaining work |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent application shell | DONE | Header, Navigator, Workspace, Inspector, and Footer remain visible during builds (`fc1b1ae`, `4db7369`); breakpoint TestBackend coverage is in `88b4aa7` |
| Responsive layouts | DONE | Wide three-pane mode, medium Inspector overlay, narrow visible pane switcher, too-small messaging, resize preservation, and all-screen boundary tests are complete |
| Focus routing | DONE | Bidirectional pane cycling, modal input trapping, nested-modal return targets, exact pane restoration, quit cancellation, and responsive focus rendering are covered |
| Dialogs | DONE | One typed FIFO queue drives build, image, recipe, Devtool, BBMASK, editor, quit, and completion workflows; invalid actions are inert and asynchronous completion waits behind active input |
| Command palette | DONE | Typed catalog, case-insensitive search, contextual availability, disabled explanations, inert invalid activation, focus restore, themes, and narrow rendering are covered |
| Themes | DONE | Five complete semantic palettes cover shell, focus, selection, status, severity, progress, dialogs, notifications, and syntax; monochrome/no-color use terminal attributes |
| Task animation | DONE | UI-tick fast/slow cadence, stable reduced-motion activity, honest unknown progress, and nonanimated determinate/terminal rows have reducer and TestBackend coverage |
| Background-job model | DONE | Stable IDs, typed lifecycle/context/progress/result/error, bounded output/history, cancellation capability, and reducer coverage are implemented |
| Background build execution | DONE | Confirmed builds allocate one job; typed events drive lifecycle/output; navigation persists; failure, cancellation rejection/acknowledgement, and backend loss are covered |
| Live BitBake bridge | DONE | Tinfoil-backed workspace, variable, recipe, layer, parse/task/log events, normal completion, cancellation, and shutdown passed against BitBake 2.19.0 / Poky 6.0.99 snapshot on qemux86-64 |
| Typed backend boundary | DONE | Typed workspace and metadata events normalize in the app into reducer actions; unknown events are safe, missing progress remains unknown, terminal lifecycle updates are singular, and the UI boundary rejects backend parsing |
| Logs workspace | DONE | Protected-diagnostic retention, bounded bytes/entries, safe truncation, coalescing, pressure counters, follow/pause, both-axis scrolling, search, all filters, selected Inspector, source opening, and clipboard effects are covered |
| Errors workspace | DONE | Stable structured diagnostics drive the full list and Inspector, exact retained-log and source navigation, related context, visible loss counters, and actionable success/warning/failure/cancellation/backend-loss outcomes |
| Layers workspace | DONE | Every configured layer stays visible above a stable-path lazy tree; priority, compatibility, active/Git state, subtree refresh, hidden/search filtering, typed Inspector modes, safe 64 KiB text/binary previews, and responsive failure-safe rendering are tested |
| Recipes workspace | DONE | Live-validated typed metadata, identity-stable Inspector states, typed BitBake operations, provider/log/local-patch navigation, editor failures, integrated Devtool routes, and persistent capability-aware CVE/SPDX actions are covered |
| Configuration workspace | DONE | Live-validated metadata, searchable responsive detail, typed copy/source/scope/compare actions, and allowlisted previewed atomic local.conf edits with exact refresh are complete |
| Devtool status | DONE | Absolute recipe identity, executable capability, workspace membership/source path, Git branch/head and dirty counts, typed partial/error states, shared disabled reasons, responsive rendering, fake-process tests, and a live no-workspace query are complete |
| Persistent Devtool jobs | DONE | Typed shell-free operations stream bounded stdout/stderr into durable background jobs; navigation, cancellation, all terminal outcomes, runner loss, and independent BitBake coordination are covered |
| Devtool modify/edit/build | DONE | Exact-identity status gates an explicit modify preview; successful persistent completion refreshes the authoritative source tree, opens the two-pane editor, and routes saved Ctrl+B requests through confirmed recipe builds |
| Devtool update-recipe | DONE | Exact-identity workspace eligibility gates a provider-aware confirmation; persistent success refreshes the original identity after navigation while failures retain prior status and job output |
| Devtool finish | DONE | Clean committed workspace eligibility gates an absolute configured-layer picker and exact provider/layer/path confirmation; native paths survive the adapter and completion refreshes the original identity |
| Devtool deploy-target | DONE | Exact-identity workspace eligibility and validated target drafts gate provider-aware confirmation; persistent success refreshes the original identity and failures retain status/job context |
| Devtool reset | DONE | Exact-identity removable workspace status gates provider/source destructive confirmation; persistent success refreshes expected non-membership while failures retain durable context |
| Dependency graph model | DONE | Typed recipe/task identities and build/runtime/task edges normalize deterministically; reverse lookup, cycle-safe bounded shortest why-built paths, explicit partial/failure states, selection stability, and typed app event mapping pass focused and baseline tests |
| Dependency graph acquisition | DONE | Additive typed protocol events use structured `generateDepTreeEvent`; legacy peers fall back honestly and the shell-free `bitbake -g` adapter bounds and validates task-dot output. Live BitBake 2.19.0 / Yocto 6.0.99 snapshot returned 962 nodes and 1,779 build/runtime/task edges |
| Dependency workspace | DONE | Graph-only typed rows, explicit state rendering, reverse/outgoing Inspector context, bounded why-built paths, identity-stable navigation, authoritative recipe/provider/log actions, and responsive boundary tests are complete |
| Tasks workspace | DONE | Live BitBake runqueue totals drive honest progress and aggregate waiting rows; typed active/completed/failure state, all specified filters, bounded selection, responsive tables, and contextual Inspector details are tested |
| Images workspace | IN_PROGRESS | Image-recipe listing and confirmed image builds exist (`7fb89fb`); deploy artifacts, manifests, checksums, licenses, and inspector details remain |
| Image artifact model | DONE | Exact machine/image/path identities, typed available-versus-unavailable metadata, deterministic bounds, correlated lifecycle states, identity-stable selection/search, reducer effects, and app event normalization pass focused and baseline checks |
| Image artifact adapter | DONE | Tinfoil/environment snapshots expose `DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`; the cancellable bounded adapter validates the machine/root, refuses symlinks and escapes, classifies deploy records, parses checksum associations, and reports partial data explicitly |
| Images artifact UI | DONE | Retained recipe picker/build confirmation now coexists with correlated CLI-owned scans, search and exact selection, typed build/editor actions, explicit lifecycle/limitations, responsive Workspace/Inspector rendering, footer hints, and direct tests |
| Settings workspace | DONE | Six typed visual/log rows apply immediately, persist atomically without rewriting config.toml, preserve precedence, and retain retryable dirty state on failure |
| Signature model | DONE | Exact recipe/task/hash/path identities, explicit bounded dump/comparison states, deterministic typed differences, identity-stable selection, stale-result correlation, reducer effects, and typed backend-event mapping are verified |
| Signature adapter | DONE | Shell-free bounded dumpsig/diffsigs adapters validate canonical artifact paths, exact correlation, timeout/cancellation, typed parsing and failures. Live BitBake 2.19.0 returned two real records and 113 typed differences with one explicit recursive-detail limitation |
| Signature workspace | DONE | `Z` opens an authoritative focus-trapped task picker and responsive child workspace with exact record/sides, typed details/differences, provider navigation, and cancellable background execution |
| Package data model | DONE | Exact identities, available-versus-unavailable fields, explicit bounded inventory/detail states, deterministic normalization, selection, stale correlation, search, dependency navigation, and typed event/effect mapping pass focused and baseline checks |
| Package data adapter | DONE | Validated shell-free discovery and exact batched `oe-pkgdata-util` commands return bounded typed inventory/detail data with unavailable fields, timeouts, cancellation, symlink/failure handling, and fake-process coverage. The real smoke was attempted but `build/tmp/pkgdata` is absent, so no live package-data compatibility is claimed |
| Package data workspace | DONE | Packages is a Navigator destination with correlated background inventory/detail execution, cancellation, search, stable selection, bounded dependency navigation history, exact recipe/provider actions, responsive explicit states, footer hints, and TestBackend coverage |

## Priority queue

1. `IMAGES-001` — verify the complete Images parent gate
2. `QEMU-001` — add a managed runqemu workflow
3. `WIC-001` — add the Wic image workflow
4. `SDK-001` — add the SDK artifact workflow
5. `TEST-001` — add unified test execution and results

## Rules

- This document must agree with `docs/task-registry.toml`.
- Parent capability descriptions are not completion evidence.
- A task is `DONE` only after its verification command passes.
- Every intentional UI change updates `docs/ui-spec.md`.
- Every architecture change updates `docs/architecture.md`.
- Completed tasks should include the implementing commit in the registry notes.
