# Yoctui Implementation Status

The machine-readable source of truth is `docs/task-registry.toml`.

Status values:

- `NOT_STARTED`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `BLOCKED`
- `DONE`

## Current phase

Add authoritative Devtool workspace and Git status while live configuration-detail validation is externally blocked. The Recipes workspace is complete alongside the lazy Layers tree and persistent workbench.

## Current task

See `docs/current-task.md`.

## Milestone summary

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Governance | DONE | Contracts, registry, active-task handoff, and repository reconciliation are in place |
| M1 BitBake cockpit | IN_PROGRESS | Typed background build execution and live BitBake 2.19.0 Tinfoil validation exist; remaining typed cockpit workflows are incomplete |
| M2 Persistent workbench | IN_PROGRESS | Persistent shell, responsive modes, focus, dialogs, palette, preferences, live Tasks, and background build jobs are complete; Logs, Errors, and Images remain partial |
| M3 Development workbench | IN_PROGRESS | Lazy Layers and Recipes workspaces are complete; configuration provenance and Devtool remain partial; signatures and package data have not started |
| M4 Images/SDK/QEMU/Wic | IN_PROGRESS | Image-recipe listing and build selection exist; artifact, SDK, QEMU, and Wic workflows remain |
| M5 Testing/QA/Security | NOT_STARTED | Coverage infrastructure exists; product workflows remain |
| M6 Maintenance | NOT_STARTED | Partial diagnostics only |
| M7 Hardening | IN_PROGRESS | Coverage and profiling foundations exist |

## Reconciliation evidence

| Capability | Status | Evidence and remaining work |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent application shell | DONE | Header, Navigator, Workspace, Inspector, and Footer remain visible during builds (`fc1b1ae`, `4db7369`); breakpoint TestBackend coverage is in `88b4aa7` |
| Responsive layouts | DONE | Wide three-pane mode, medium Inspector overlay, narrow visible pane switcher, too-small messaging, resize preservation, and all-screen boundary tests are complete |
| Focus routing | DONE | Bidirectional pane cycling, modal input trapping, nested-modal return targets, exact pane restoration, quit cancellation, and responsive focus rendering are covered |
| Dialogs | DONE | One typed FIFO queue drives build, image, recipe, Devtool, BBMASK, editor, quit, and completion workflows; invalid actions are inert and asynchronous completion waits behind active input |
| Command palette | DONE | Typed catalog, case-insensitive search, contextual availability, disabled explanations, inert invalid activation, focus restore, themes, and narrow rendering are covered |
| Themes | DONE | Five complete semantic palettes cover shell, focus, selection, status, severity, progress, dialogs, notifications, and syntax; monochrome/no-color use terminal attributes |
| Task animation | DONE | UI-tick fast/slow cadence, stable reduced-motion activity, honest unknown progress, and nonanimated determinate/terminal rows have reducer and TestBackend coverage |
| Background-job model | DONE | Stable IDs, typed lifecycle/context/progress/result/error, bounded output/history, cancellation capability, and reducer coverage are implemented |
| Background build execution | DONE | Confirmed builds allocate one job; typed events drive lifecycle/output; navigation persists; failure, cancellation rejection/acknowledgement, and backend loss are covered |
| Live BitBake bridge | DONE | Tinfoil-backed workspace, variable, recipe, layer, parse/task/log events, normal completion, cancellation, and shutdown passed against BitBake 2.19.0 / Poky 6.0.99 snapshot on qemux86-64 |
| Typed backend boundary | DONE | Typed workspace and metadata events normalize in the app into reducer actions; unknown events are safe, missing progress remains unknown, terminal lifecycle updates are singular, and the UI boundary rejects backend parsing |
| Logs workspace | DONE | Protected-diagnostic retention, bounded bytes/entries, safe truncation, coalescing, pressure counters, follow/pause, both-axis scrolling, search, all filters, selected Inspector, source opening, and clipboard effects are covered |
| Errors workspace | DONE | Stable structured diagnostics drive the full list and Inspector, exact retained-log and source navigation, related context, visible loss counters, and actionable success/warning/failure/cancellation/backend-loss outcomes |
| Layers workspace | DONE | Every configured layer stays visible above a stable-path lazy tree; priority, compatibility, active/Git state, subtree refresh, hidden/search filtering, typed Inspector modes, safe 64 KiB text/binary previews, and responsive failure-safe rendering are tested |
| Recipes workspace | DONE | Live-validated typed metadata, identity-stable Inspector states, typed BitBake operations, provider/log/local-patch navigation, editor failures, integrated Devtool routes, and persistent capability-aware CVE/SPDX actions are covered |
| Configuration workspace | BLOCKED | Typed scoped expanded/unexpanded detail, varhistory operations, active overrides, compatibility defaults, and local tests are complete; a live Tinfoil query cannot create its lock/socket in the external build directory because escalation usage is exhausted until 2026-07-28 20:08 |
| Tasks workspace | DONE | Live BitBake runqueue totals drive honest progress and aggregate waiting rows; typed active/completed/failure state, all specified filters, bounded selection, responsive tables, and contextual Inspector details are tested |
| Images workspace | IN_PROGRESS | Image-recipe listing and confirmed image builds exist (`7fb89fb`); deploy artifacts, manifests, checksums, licenses, and inspector details remain |
| Settings workspace | DONE | Six typed visual/log rows apply immediately, persist atomically without rewriting config.toml, preserve precedence, and retain retryable dirty state on failure |
| Signature workflows | NOT_STARTED | No adapter, typed workflow, UI, or tests are present |
| Package data browser | NOT_STARTED | No `oe-pkgdata-util` adapter, workspace, typed workflow, or tests are present |

## Priority queue

1. `DEVTOOL-META-001` — add authoritative workspace and Git status
2. `DEVTOOL-JOBS-001` — run Devtool operations as persistent jobs
3. `DEVTOOL-MODIFY-001` — complete modify, edit, and build
4. `DEVTOOL-PUBLISH-001` — complete update-recipe and finish
5. `DEVTOOL-TARGET-001` — complete deploy-target and reset
6. `CONFIG-META-001` — run live Tinfoil validation after escalation is available

## Rules

- This document must agree with `docs/task-registry.toml`.
- Parent capability descriptions are not completion evidence.
- A task is `DONE` only after its verification command passes.
- Every intentional UI change updates `docs/ui-spec.md`.
- Every architecture change updates `docs/architecture.md`.
- Completed tasks should include the implementing commit in the registry notes.
