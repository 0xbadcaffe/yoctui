# Current Task

**ID:** M67-LIVE-EVIDENCE-001
**Title:** Supply current-source real-Poky release performance evidence
**Status:** BLOCKED

The retained performance evidence is not bound to the current source tree: it
has 143 previously documented source digest mismatches, including changes
predating M67. Supply a new genuine source/binary-bound Yocto 6.0.2 linux-yocto
compile capture using the documented release workload. Do not rewrite historical
digests or substitute fake-process startup timings for live evidence.

```bash
./scripts/verify-performance.sh --real-poky-evidence
./scripts/verify-completion.sh
```

This external prerequisite is the only remaining required task. The user
explicitly deferred the full suite; do not run the full completion suite without
a subsequent instruction. All M105/M106 requested corrections are DONE:
v0.1.258 target RootFS owner/group/mode, v0.1.259 systemd viewport scrolling,
and v0.1.260 single search activity marker. Focused verification and genuine
read-only Romulus ownership smoke pass. Seven optional wider UI assertions
fail identically on the previous commit and are documented, not weakened.
No overall completion/performance certification is claimed. Final push and
source-bound optimized binary handoff deliver these fixes; installed PATH
binary is still v0.1.250, so use target/release/yoctui explicitly.
